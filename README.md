how-many-lines
==============

I always wanted to know how many lines of code I wrote in a project so I created this little script to do so. I created it for Codeigniter as I use it most often but with a bit of coding you can adjust it to your needs.

P.S. Please keep in mind that I never wrote code in Python before.
